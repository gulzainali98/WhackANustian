# WhackANustian
This is a game developed in OpenGL. It shows different figures from my class on different places and you can whack them by using corresponding numpad keys. In short, it is a localized version of whack a mole.
ENJOY :D

This was my first semester Fundamentals of Programming project and you can check out the presentation to get a feel of how this game works here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xWbr-gqXjzxuclyGsNsvj2_eSk0QzRgN/view?usp=sharing
